			<center>
			<p>With a series of global voting campaigns, New7Wonders is inspiring and making people more aware of the legacy we are handing on to our children. Through its campaigns, New7Wonders highlights what unites us — as opposed to what separates us — and also emphasizes the importance of caring for what will be left for the next generations.
				
The Official New 7 Wonders of the World campaign was the first worldwide democratic exercise in mankind’s history. For the first time we (millions of people from all over the world) created Global Memory: 7 things for everyone to remember, and 7 symbols of unity that respect, honour and celebrate the cultural diversity of our planet.</p>
